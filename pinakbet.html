    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pinakbet is nutritious as it is delicious! A colorful medley of local vegetables, pork belly, and shrimp paste, this classic vegetable stew is perfect as a main entree or as a side dish to fried fish or grilled meat.</p>
    <p>Pinakbet or Pakbet is a Filipino vegetable stew from the Ilocos region. Its name is derived from the Ilocano word pinakebbet which means “shriveled”, in reference to the vegetables being sweated in the pot over low heat until “shrunken”.
        The dish makes use of indigenous produce, root crops, and beans that are accessible and plentiful in the area such as okra, ginger, tomatoes, eggplant, ampalaya, sitaw, siling duwag, and kamote. It’s traditionally flavored with bagoong monamon, a type of seasoning made of fermented fish. Other ingredients such as diced pork, crispy bagnet, shrimp or pre-cooked fish are added for flavor.</p>
